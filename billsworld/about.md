<h2 id="whatisbillsworld">What is Bill's World</h2>

<p>Bill's World welcomes you!. Bill's World is my personal web space where I share what I think about and what I care about. I am an eclectic person that has been shaped by personal experiences and my quest for life-long learning.</p>

<p>I believe information is the gateway to personal choice and the lack of it is the gateway to personal chains. Consistent with this belief, this website contains original and curated plain-language content on various topics including but not limited to research, development,assistive technology, disability, information technology, accessibility,social work, social justice, public policy, public health, and information science.</p>

<h2 id="whoisbill">Who is Bill</h2>

<p>I was born with a congenital disabilty known as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/facts.html" target="blank">cerebral palsy</a> in Montreal Quebec Canada. As a result of the love and constant support I received from my mother, father, brother, and sister, I dare to be different and dare to "march to the beat of my own drummer." I am comfortable in my own skin.</p>

<p>This has not always been the case. In fact, in my younger years, I did not "march to the beat of my own drummer." And I was not comfortable in my own skin. I felt the pressure to conform to societal expectations of normalcy. Doctors and psychologists and physiotherapists and teachers and a whole host of other professionals worked with me so that I became as "normal" as possible. I became "super cripple" always proving to the nay sayers that I could do what they said I could not do. I had to prove that I could function as "normal as possible" compared to my peers without a disability. Amd by becoming as "normal as possible", folks without a disability did not feel as threatened by my differences due to my disability.</p>

<h2 id="whatmymotherandfathertaughtme">What My Mother and Father Taught Me</h2>

One of my favourite quotes comes from Theodore Roosevelt He said,

<blockquote style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;color:black">"Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care." </blockquote>

<p>This quote embodies who I am and why I do what I do.</p>

<p>Caring is what makes us human. I learned that from my mother at a very early age. If she had not cared about me, I would not be who and where I am today. I would probably be in an institution. I was born with cerebral palsy and because my mother cared so much about me she taught me to believe in myself and what I could become—anything that I put my mind to was possible. If you can see it in your mind, you can achieve it. She also instilled in me a conviction that goes beyond words, beyond geography. It is a relentless will to "try until you die" because success is not defined by what you achieve but by what you attempt.</p>

<p>My father also taught me some valuable lessons through what he said, what he did, and how he lived his life. He was the best father a boy could have. My father was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, now known as the Czech Republic. He appreciated freedom and the ability to pursue his own happiness. He came by this appreciation through first-hand knowledge. As a boy of thirteen, he fought against the Nazis in World War II. After World War II, he refused to accept communism when the Russians took over his country. He tried to escape many times, and one night with a band of his closest friends, he escaped to an American air force base in West Germany. He became a displaced person and was sent to Canada. In Canada, he worked all kinds of jobs and one of his first jobs paid him 22 cents an hour for 22 hours of hard work per day. From these humble beginnings in Canada, he transformed his life by learning English at night school and became one of the most respected international businessmen in the footwear industry.</p>

<p>From my father I learned that there is value in the struggle. I also learned that life will deal you many good and bad things. And it is how you handle these things that makes you a man. Life without adversity is a life without meaning. The joy of life lies not in the destination but rather in the journey. And my father told me that my journey in life required more preparation than most because I would have to live my life with with a disability. Because I could not play sports or run, he told me that my mind was my greatest weapon or tool that needed to be developed as much as possible. My mind would help me when my legs may not. He stressed education and encouraged me to go as far as I could with the capabilities I had. But education to both my father and mother came from many sources like different people, different places, and of course—books and formal institutions of learning.</p>

<h2 id="importanceofeducationandwork">The Importance of Education and Work</h2>

<p>I took the advice and counsel of both my parents seriously and spent a lot of my time in school. Growing up books were my friends because they did not reject me. They opened a world of possibility to me. They were (and still are) my companions on my journey of life-long learning. I attained a Bachelor's Degree in French and Spanish Literature with a minor in conversational Portuguese and psychology in three years at the University of Miami in Florida. I went to Georgetown Law School for one year but soon discovered that law was not something I wanted to pursue. At the time, I was only twenty years of age and did not view law school as a place that aligned with my need to help people. I thought law school was a formal "trade school for words" that enabled its graduates to make money. This is not a negative comment about lawyers; it is just how I felt at the time.</p>

<p>I left law school and went to work for the DC Center for Independent Living (DCCIL) where I translated materials from English to Spanish and co-facilitated a Spanish Language peer support group. My experience at DCCIL helped me to identify what was really important to me: Making a difference in the lives of people with disabilities. After two years at DCCIL, and much research about what profession to pursue that aligned with my personal values, I attained a Master's degree in Social Work with concentrations in health and mental health policy and practice from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>

<p>After receiving my Master's degree, I did not go straight into a PhD program. One of my mentors, Dr. Anthony Halter, advised against it. He said you need to get enough work experience to really understand the kinds of problems people face. And then, equipped with a "real-world" base, the pursuit of a doctorate degree will have more meaning than simply climbing another rung on the academic ladder. In other words, it will give you the "why behind your what" or the reasons why you want a PhD. This advice seemed sound to me, and also my mother. Initially she did not want me to get a doctorate because she did not want me to use big words that no one understood. She also reminded me that folks with PhDs often think that they are more important than they really are. So after much searching, I landed a job as the Public Inquiry Services Manager at the National Rehabilitation Information Center (NARIC).</p>

<p>NARIC is a national disability information and referral center and official library for the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research. I worked at NARIC for six years. In my role as Public Inquiry Services Manager, I had the privilege of heading a team of four librarians. It was my job to develop resources for the librarians who responded to numerous telephone and snail mail inquiries from patrons who needed relevant disability information and resources to solve their problems. We received relatively few email inquiries during that time as the importance of the internet and the web was just emerging. In addition to developing resources for my team to use to serve patrons, I also handled numerous phone calls that required in-depth knowledge of social services for people who were just not getting the services they sought—no matter what they tried. I and my team took pride in listening to people's disability-related problems and then connecting them to resources they could use to solve their own problems. Working at the nexus between the problems people experienced and the resources they needed to deal with them taught me a great deal. As a result of my experience at NARIC, I coined this phrase, "Information is the gateway to personal choice while the lack of it is the gateway to personal chains." My NARIC experience now gave me my "why behind my what" and launched me on a journey in pursuit of my doctorate. I wanted to use a doctorate to be the "Robin Hood of Rehabilitation to steal from the information rich and give to the information poor."</p>

<p>I left NARIC and got accepted into a joint Social Work PhD and Master's in Public Health program at the University of Pittsburgh. While there I became sort of a disability resource consultant to the staff in the School of Social Work and the School of Public health. I also consulted with the faculty in the Department of Health Information Management in the School of Rehabilitation Sciences. While pursuing my joint degrees, I worked as a teaching assistant, taught undergraduate courses, built websites for various faculty members, and analyzed community-based research data. My focus at Pitt was on disability policy and policy implementation. I enjoyed my time there because it allowed me to develop and maintain an interdisciplinary focus, and hone my research, policy, and program evaluation skills. These skills serve me well in the disability and rehabilitation field because problems related to disability often require an interdisciplinary or cross disciplinary approach.</p>

<p>After obtaining my joint Social Work PhD and Master's in Public Health degrees, I worked as an independent consultant for one year. Then, I was recruited and hired by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), now known as the National Institute on Disability Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) within the Administration for Community Living. I have been with NIDRR/NIDILRR since February of 2002. A big part of my work at NIDILRR involves helping stakeholders (e.g., researchers, clinicians, policy people, people with disabilities and family members, etc.) understand and use the results that come out of our funded disability research and development efforts. To honor my mother and father, I try to use plain language to explain how results from research and development can positively impact the lives of people.</p>
