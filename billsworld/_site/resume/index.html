<p>Back in 1984, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Miami. I wanted to give back and make a difference to a cause I cared about–United Cerebral Palsy. My reason for caring was personal as I have cerebral palsy. I also loved swimming and used to swim at the University of Miami daily. My close friend and college suite-mate, Sheik Baksh, worked with me to leverage, mobilize, and coordinate resources to make  the Swim-a-thon. an event that was part of Homecoming. I swam 300 laps and raised money, along with numerous other pledgers, including members of the UM swim team. The event was very successful and raised $3000-4000 in 1984 and $8000 in 1985.</p>

<p>All throughout my time in high school I had an interest in helping those less fortunate, especially immigrants. I was also studying French and Spanish and wanted to use my linguistic skills to serve and support under-represented groups in my community. So I encouraged students at my school to donate clothes, food and other supplies to the Haitian and Cuban refugee camps in Miami. I set up donation bins in school and at breaks, I asked my parents to drive me down to the the Haitian and Cuban refugee camps. I spoke both the leaders of these camps and temporary residents of these camps. These individuals expressed their profound gratitude for my efforts as the donations I collected helped new refugees get a “fresh start” in their new country.</p>
